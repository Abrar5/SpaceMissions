The dataset (Space_Corrected.csv from https://www.kaggle.com/agirlcoding/all-space-missions-from-1957) includes all the space missions since the beginning of Space Race (1957). It contains 9 rows and 4323 observations  which are:
	- #: Column number.
	- Unnamed: Column number.
	- Company Name.
	- Location: Location of the Launch.
	- Datum: Datum and Time of Launch.
	- Detail: Rocket Name.
	- Status Rocket: Status of the rocket.
	- Rocket: Cost of the mission: in $ million.
	- Status Mission: Status of the mission whether it is successful or not.

I expected playing around with  'Company Name, Location, and Status Mission', and predicting the next mission status (absolutely wishing for more!) using:
	-  numpy. 
	- pandas.
	- seaborn.
	- matplotlib.pyplot.
	- & (open for more others!)

The dataset is useful for people who are interested in knowing more about space discoveries.

The goal is to have better understanding of the following:
	- How many missions per country?
	- Which country has the most space launchings?
	- Which company has the highest number of launches?
	- Why some missions cost more than others? 
	- What year that have the most successful/failure missions?
	- What are the missions status percentage? (successful?/failure?)
